# Influence of perinatal ampicillin exposure on maternal fecal microbial and metabolic profiles

ABSTRACT
Indirect exposure to antibiotics during early life, via maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) or postpartum maternal antibiotic usage, is increasingly common and has been epidemiologically linked to altered growth and immune developmental trajectories in offspring. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the effects of antepartum and postpartum maternal ampicillin administration on the dams' fecal microbiome and metabolic profiles in vivo. Ampicillin caused a reproducible depletion of beneficial bacterial species belonging to the Muribaculaceae family, including Muribaculum intestinale and Duncaniella dubosii, and led to cohort-dependent enrichments of Enterococcus and Prevotella species. These microbial alterations were accompanied by substantial metabolic remodeling, characterized by elevated fecal acylcarnitines and dysregulation of the bile acids profile. Intriguingly, we identified two previously uncharacterized trihydroxylated bile acids conjugated to a hexose moiety, which appeared to be associated with antibiotic exposure across public metabolomics repositories. These alterations in the fecal maternal microbiome and metabolome coincided with increased weight gain in offspring, suggesting a possible role for maternal antibiotic exposure in shaping early developmental trajectories. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the long-term implications of these changes in infant health.
